# Executive Summary
- File: config/initializers/inflections.rb
- TL;DR: Template initializer showing how to define custom word inflection rules (pluralization, singularization, acronyms) via ActiveSupport::Inflector. Currently no rules are active; all examples are commented out.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| Block with parameters (`do |inflect| ... end`) | Anonymous function passed to a method | C# lambda/delegate passed to a config/builder method |
| Regular expressions (`/^(ox)$/i`) | Regex literal with flags (`i` = case-insensitive) and capture groups | .NET Regex with options: `new Regex("^(ox)$", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)` |
| Backreferences in replacements (`"\\1"`) | Uses captured group 1 in replacement | C# regex replacement `$1` |
| Symbols (`:en`) | Immutable interned identifiers used as lightweight keys | C#: enum-like or interned string key; TS: string literal union value |
| Namespacing (`ActiveSupport::Inflector`) | Module/class scoping with `::` | C# namespaces/types (`Namespace.Class`) |
| `%w( ... )` array literal | Array of strings without quotes/commas | C#: `new[] { "fish", "sheep" }`; TS: `["fish","sheep"]` |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| Initializer (`config/initializers/*.rb`) | Code loaded at app boot for framework/global config | ASP.NET Core Program.cs/Startup.cs configuration |
| ActiveSupport::Inflector | Utility for pluralize/singularize/camelize, etc. | No built-in equivalent; closest is custom naming policies or Humanizer-like libs |
| Locale-specific inflections (`inflections(:en)`) | Rules scoped per locale | Culture-specific config using CultureInfo |
| `plural`/`singular` rules | Regex-based mappings for word forms | Custom naming conventions/utilities in middleware/startup |
| `irregular` | Explicit singular/plural pair that doesn’t follow rules | Manual exception list for naming |
| `acronym` | Treat tokens as acronyms for camelization/constantization | Custom casing rules (e.g., System.Text.Json naming policies) |

# Code Anatomy
- ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(locale = :en) { |inflect| ... } — Entry point to register rules for a given locale.
- inflect.plural(pattern, replacement) — Add a pluralization regex rule.
- inflect.singular(pattern, replacement) — Add a singularization regex rule.
- inflect.irregular(singular, plural) — Define an explicit irregular pair.
- inflect.uncountable(words_array) — Mark words with identical singular/plural.
- inflect.acronym(word) — Register acronym so camelize/underscore treat it as a unit.

All of the above are currently commented out; no active configuration exists in this file.

# Suggestions for Improvements
- Add only the rules you actually need (keep examples commented). Rationale: Avoid unexpected renames across helpers relying on inflection behavior.
  ```ruby
  # config/initializers/inflections.rb
  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
    inflect.irregular "analysis", "analyses"
    inflect.uncountable %w( fish equipment )
  end
  ```

- Define acronyms used in class/module names to keep intended casing. Rationale: Prevent mis-camelization (e.g., ApiKey vs APIKey).
  ```ruby
  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
    inflect.acronym "API"
    inflect.acronym "RESTful"
  end
  ```

- Prefer specific regex rules only when irregular doesn’t suffice. Rationale: Regex rules are harder to reason about and can have unintended matches.
  ```ruby
  # Prefer
  inflect.irregular "person", "people"
  # Instead of
  inflect.plural(/^(person)$/i, "\\1people")  # harder to maintain
  ```

- Keep rules scoped to :en unless you truly support multiple locales. Rationale: Minimizes confusion and avoids partial locale coverage.
  ```ruby
  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) { |inflect| inflect.irregular "cactus", "cacti" }
  ```

- Add a quick console check when modifying rules. Rationale: Validate behavior before committing.
  ```ruby
  # In Rails console
  "analysis".pluralize         # => "analyses"
  "API_response".camelize      # With acronym "API" => "APIResponse"
  ```
