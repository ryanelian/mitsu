# Executive Summary
- File: config/puma.rb
- TL;DR: Configures Puma (Rails app server) concurrency and runtime settings via environment variables: threads, optional multi-process workers in production, port, environment, PID file, and a dev restart plugin. These settings control how many requests your app can handle concurrently and affect memory, startup, and dev ergonomics.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ENV.fetch("KEY") { default } | Read env var with a fallback | C#: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("KEY") ?? "default" |
| Integer(value) | Convert to Integer or raise on invalid | C#: Convert.ToInt32 / int.Parse |
| Symbols (e.g., :tmp_restart) | Immutable interned identifiers | C#: enum-like identifiers; TS: const string literal types |
| Method calls in a DSL (threads, workers) | Evaluated in Puma’s config context | C#: builder pattern (HostBuilder/Kestrel options) |
| if … end | Standard conditional | C#/TS: if (…) { … } |
| Local variables | Simple assignment (e.g., rails_env) | C#/TS: local variables |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Puma | The HTTP app server for Rails | ASP.NET Core Kestrel |
| Threads min/max | Puma thread pool per process | Kestrel/ThreadPool concurrency (not usually user-set) |
| Workers | Forked OS processes for the app | Multiple IIS/Kestrel worker processes or container replicas |
| preload_app! | Preload app before forking for CoW memory savings | App warmup before spawning workers (no direct Kestrel equivalent) |
| RAILS_ENV | Rails environment mode | ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT |
| plugin :tmp_restart | Allows `bin/rails restart` in dev | dotnet watch / hot reload convenience |

# Code Anatomy
- threads(min_threads_count, max_threads_count): Sets per-process thread pool size from RAILS_MIN_THREADS/RAILS_MAX_THREADS (defaults 5).
- rails_env = ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV") { "development" }: Determines environment.
- if rails_env == "production": Production-only multi-process logic.
  - worker_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 1 }): Reads worker process count.
  - workers(worker_count) if worker_count > 1: Enables multi-process mode.
  - else preload_app!: Preloads app only when single worker.
- worker_timeout 3600 if ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV", "development") == "development": Long dev timeout to ease debugging.
- port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3000 }: HTTP port.
- environment rails_env: Applies environment.
- pidfile ENV.fetch("PIDFILE") { "tmp/pids/server.pid" }: PID file location.
- plugin :tmp_restart: Enable `bin/rails restart`.

# Critical Issues
No critical bugs found

# Performance Issues
- Severity: Medium | What/Where: preload_app! inside production block only when worker_count <= 1 | Why: With multiple workers, not preloading forfeits copy-on-write memory savings and increases per-worker boot time | How to fix: Call preload_app! when worker_count > 1 (or unconditionally in production).
  ```ruby
  if rails_env == "production"
    worker_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 1 })
    workers worker_count if worker_count > 1
    preload_app! if worker_count > 1
  end
  ```

# Suggestions for Improvements
- Preload in multi-worker production for memory efficiency:
  ```ruby
  if rails_env == "production"
    worker_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 1 })
    workers worker_count if worker_count > 1
    preload_app! if worker_count > 1
  end
  ```
- Reuse rails_env for the dev timeout check to avoid duplicate ENV reads:
  ```ruby
  worker_timeout 3600 if rails_env == "development"
  ```
- Make thread counts explicitly numeric to be defensive when env vars are set:
  ```ruby
  max_threads_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 })
  min_threads_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("RAILS_MIN_THREADS") { max_threads_count })
  threads min_threads_count, max_threads_count
  ```
- Add brief inline docs to guide ops (what to set in production), aiding parity with ASP.NET deployment knobs:
  - RAILS_MAX_THREADS / RAILS_MIN_THREADS: per-process concurrency
  - WEB_CONCURRENCY: number of worker processes (match CPU cores)
  - PORT, PIDFILE, RAILS_ENV: standard runtime controls
