# Executive Summary
- File: config/routes.rb
- TL;DR: Defines a single GET route at /pricing that dispatches to PricingController#index. This is the entry in Rails’ routing table that wires an HTTP request to a controller action.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constant lookup (Rails) | Rails is a top-level constant (module) providing framework APIs. | Using static Framework class (e.g., ASP.NET Core’s WebApplication). |
| Method call with block (routes.draw do … end) | Passing a block to a method; the block forms a DSL context. | Builder pattern with lambdas, e.g., app.MapGroup("/").Configure(x => …). |
| do … end block | Block syntax to group code passed to a method. | Lambda passed to configuration methods in Startup/Program.cs. |
| Keyword arguments (to:) | Named argument passed to a method; syntactic sugar for symbol-keyed hash. | Named parameters in C# method calls. |
| Single-quoted strings ('/pricing') | String literal without interpolation. | Regular string literal in C#. |
| Method invocation without parentheses (get '/pricing', …) | Ruby allows omitting parentheses in many calls, common in DSLs. | Fluent/DSL style methods in C# where parentheses are still required. |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Routing DSL (Rails.application.routes.draw) | Central place to declare URL mappings. | In Program.cs: app.MapControllers() + attribute routes. |
| HTTP verb route (get) | Declares a GET route. | [HttpGet("/pricing")] on a controller action. |
| Path string ('/pricing') | Literal URL matched by the route. | Route template in attribute routing. |
| Controller#action ('pricing#index') | Target controller and action method. | Controller/Action mapping, e.g., PricingController.Index(). |
| Implicit controller naming | 'pricing' maps to PricingController by convention. | PricingController class in ASP.NET Core discovered by routing. |

# Code Anatomy
- Rails.application.routes.draw { … } — Enters the routing DSL to declare routes.
- get(path, to:) — Declares a GET route mapping.
  - get '/pricing', to: 'pricing#index' — Maps GET /pricing to PricingController#index.

# Suggestions for Improvements
1) Add a named route helper for ergonomic URL generation
- Rationale: Without a name, you don’t get a pricing_path/pricing_url helper; naming improves maintainability.
```ruby
# Before
get '/pricing', to: 'pricing#index'

# After
get '/pricing', to: 'pricing#index', as: :pricing
```

2) Prefer idiomatic path style (omit leading slash)
- Rationale: Rails routing treats both the same; omitting the slash matches common style in guides and other codebases.
```ruby
# Before
get '/pricing', to: 'pricing#index'

# After
get 'pricing', to: 'pricing#index'
```

3) If this endpoint is intended to return a specific format, set a default
- Rationale: Avoids content-negotiation surprises by defaulting to a known format.
```ruby
# Example (only if desired)
get 'pricing', to: 'pricing#index', defaults: { format: :html }  # or :json
```
