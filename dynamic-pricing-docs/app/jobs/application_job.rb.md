# Executive Summary
- File: app/jobs/application_job.rb
- TL;DR: Defines the base job class for all background jobs in this Rails app. Central place to configure global job behavior like retries and discarding on specific exceptions.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Class definition | Declares a class with `class ... end`. | `class` in C# / TS. |
| Inheritance with `<` | `ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base` means subclassing. | `class ApplicationJob : ActiveJobBase` (C#) / `class ApplicationJob extends ActiveJobBase` (TS). |
| Namespacing with `::` | Constant lookup across modules/classes (e.g., `ActiveJob::Base`). | `Namespace.Class` in C# (e.g., `ActiveJob.Base`). |
| Comments with `#` | Single-line comments. | `//` in C#/TS. |
| Class-level DSL methods | `retry_on`, `discard_on` are class methods used as declarative configuration (even though commented). | Attributes/config methods on base classes, e.g., Hangfire/Polly-like retry policy configuration on a base type. |
| Constants as exception types | `ActiveRecord::Deadlocked` refers to an exception class constant. | `typeof(SqlException)` or specific exception types in C#. |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ActiveJob | Rails framework for background job abstraction. | ASP.NET Core BackgroundService/IHostedService, or using a job abstraction like Hangfire interface. |
| ApplicationJob | App-wide base class for all jobs to share configuration. | A shared abstract base class for all background jobs in C#. |
| retry_on | Declarative retry policy for specific exceptions. | Polly/Hangfire retry attributes or custom retry middleware. |
| discard_on | Silently discard jobs when certain exceptions occur. | Catch-and-ignore in a base BackgroundService, or a filter that swallows specific exceptions. |
| ActiveRecord::Deadlocked | Specific DB deadlock exception type (for retries). | SqlException with deadlock error numbers. |
| ActiveJob::DeserializationError | Raised when job arguments can’t be deserialized (e.g., record deleted). | Deserialization exceptions in message processing (e.g., JSON parse errors) leading to message drop. |

# Code Anatomy
- class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base: Base class for all jobs; place to set global job behavior such as retries/discards.
- retry_on ActiveRecord::Deadlocked (commented): Would configure automatic retries on DB deadlocks.
- discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError (commented): Would drop jobs when referenced records no longer exist.

# Suggestions for Improvements
- Enable safe retries for transient DB deadlocks
  - Rationale: Deadlocks are transient; retrying reduces job failures.
  - Before:
    ```ruby
    # retry_on ActiveRecord::Deadlocked
    ```
  - After:
    ```ruby
    class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base
      retry_on ActiveRecord::Deadlocked, wait: 2.seconds, attempts: 3
    end
    ```

- Discard jobs that can never succeed due to missing records
  - Rationale: Prevents endless retries when job arguments reference deleted records.
  - Before:
    ```ruby
    # discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError
    ```
  - After:
    ```ruby
    class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base
      discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError
    end
    ```

- Define a default queue for consistency
  - Rationale: Ensures jobs land in an expected queue; easier ops and prioritization.
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base
      queue_as :default
    end
    ```

- Centralize common logging/metrics in the base job
  - Rationale: Uniform observability across all jobs.
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base
      around_perform do |job, block|
        start = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
        block.call
      ensure
        duration_ms = ((Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) - start) * 1000).round
        Rails.logger.info "[Job] #{job.class.name} completed in #{duration_ms}ms"
      end
    end
    ```

- Provide a minimal example usage for new jobs (to guide contributors)
  - Rationale: Reduces onboarding friction; mirrors how you’d derive from a base class in C#.
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    class ExampleJob < ApplicationJob
      def perform(user_id)
        # work here
      end
    end
    ```
