# Executive Summary
- File: app/channels/application_cable/channel.rb
- TL;DR: Defines the application-wide base Action Cable channel class. Other channels should inherit from this to centralize shared WebSocket channel behavior.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| module ApplicationCable | A namespace for grouping related classes | C# namespace or TS namespace/module |
| class Channel < Base | Class declaration with inheritance | class Channel : BaseClass in C#; class Channel extends Base in TS |
| Constant namespacing (::) | Accessing a constant in another namespace | C# using fully qualified names; TS qualified imports |
| End-delimited blocks | end terminates module/class scope | Braces {} in C#/TS |
| Empty class body | Valid class that inherits behavior only | An empty subclass relying on base members |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| ActionCable | Railsâ€™ WebSocket framework | ASP.NET Core SignalR |
| ActionCable::Channel::Base | Base class providing channel lifecycle and streaming APIs | Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Hub base class |
| ApplicationCable namespace | Conventional namespace for app channels | C# namespace to group Hubs (e.g., MyApp.Hubs) |
| Channel subclass | App-specific base for all channels | A custom abstract base Hub to centralize common logic |

# Code Anatomy
- ApplicationCable (module): Namespace for Action Cable-related classes.
- ApplicationCable::Channel < ActionCable::Channel::Base: App-level base channel; inherit this in your concrete channels to share helpers and policies.

# Suggestions for Improvements
- Centralize authentication checks for all channels
  - Rationale: Ensure every channel enforces connection/user presence consistently.
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    module ApplicationCable
      class Channel < ActionCable::Channel::Base
        private

        def require_user!
          reject unless connection.respond_to?(:current_user) && connection.current_user
        end
      end
    end
    ```
  - Usage in a concrete channel:
    ```ruby
    class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
      def subscribed
        require_user!
        stream_from "chat_#{connection.current_user.id}"
      end
    end
    ```

- Add a helper to standardize stream naming
  - Rationale: Avoid duplicated string interpolation and typos across channels; improves maintainability.
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    module ApplicationCable
      class Channel < ActionCable::Channel::Base
        private

        def stream_for_user(suffix)
          uid = connection.current_user&.id
          reject unless uid
          stream_from "#{suffix}_user_#{uid}"
        end
      end
    end
    ```

- Document intended usage
  - Rationale: Guide new devs (especially from C#/TS) that this is analogous to a base SignalR Hub.
  - Example header comment:
    ```ruby
    # Base channel for app-wide helpers. Inherit in all channels (e.g., ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel).
    # Analogy: Base Hub in ASP.NET Core SignalR.
    module ApplicationCable
      class Channel < ActionCable::Channel::Base
      end
    end
    ```
