# Executive Summary
- File: db/seeds.rb
- TL;DR: The seed file is currently only comments; no data is being seeded. It’s intended to hold idempotent code to populate required records across environments via bin/rails db:seed or db:setup.

# Ruby Concepts
| Ruby Concept | What It Is | C#/TS Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Array literal | ["Action", "Comedy", ...] creates an array | C#: new[] {"Action", ...}; TS: ["Action", ...] |
| Blocks | do ... end with |param| passed to methods | C#: lambdas/delegates; TS: callbacks/arrow functions |
| Enumerable#each | Iterates over a collection yielding each item to a block | C#: foreach; TS: Array.forEach |
| Constant/class reference | MovieGenre refers to a class constant | C#: type name (e.g., MovieGenre); TS: class reference |
| Bang method (!) | Methods ending with ! usually raise on failure (e.g., validations) | C#: methods throwing exceptions vs TryXxx; TS: functions that throw |
| Comments (#) | Single-line comments with # | C#/TS: // single-line comments |

# Rails Concepts
| Rails Concept | What It Is | ASP.NET/React Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| db/seeds.rb | Central place to define baseline data | EF Core seeding via OnModelCreating.HasData or custom DataSeeder |
| bin/rails db:seed | Command to execute seeds | Run custom seeder at startup (Program.cs) or IHostedService |
| db:setup | Create DB, load schema, then seed | dotnet ef database update + run seeder on startup |
| Environments | production/development/test contexts | ASP.NET Core environments (Production/Development/Staging) |
| ActiveRecord.find_or_create_by! | Lookup by attributes or create; raises on failure | EF Core FirstOrDefault + add + SaveChanges (throw on failure) |
| Idempotent seeds | Safe to re-run without duplicating data | Seed guards/checks before insert in EF Core |

# Suggestions for Improvements
1) Add actual idempotent seeds (as hinted in the comment)
   - Rationale: Ensure required reference data exists across all environments and on re-runs.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |name|
       MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: name)
     end
     ```

2) Use transactions to keep seeds atomic and faster
   - Rationale: Either all seeds apply or none; reduces I/O round-trips.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
       ["Action", "Comedy"].each { |n| MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: n) }
     end
     ```

3) Update attributes on re-run using find_or_initialize_by + update!
   - Rationale: Idempotent and keeps seeded records current.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     admin = User.find_or_initialize_by(email: "admin@example.com")
     admin.update!(role: "admin", name: "Admin")
     ```

4) Scope environment-specific data
   - Rationale: Keep production seeds clean while allowing richer dev/test data.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     if Rails.env.development?
       User.find_or_create_by!(email: "dev@example.com") { |u| u.name = "Dev" }
     end
     ```

5) Add simple logging for visibility
   - Rationale: Easier troubleshooting in CI and deployments.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     puts "Seeding movie genres..."
     ```

6) Organize complex seeds into small files and require them
   - Rationale: Maintainability as the dataset grows.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     %w[genres users].each { |f| require_relative File.join("seeds", f) }
     ```
