# This is a Rails integration test file using Minitest (built into Rails).
# If you're coming from ASP.NET Core, think of this as analogous to using WebApplicationFactory
# and HttpClient to make end-to-end HTTP requests against your app. Rails provides helpers
# like `get`, `post`, etc., plus assertions for the response.
# The tests below exercise the PricingController's `pricing` endpoint by issuing GET requests
# with various query parameters and validating the JSON responses and HTTP status codes.

require "test_helper"  # Loads the Rails test environment and Minitest setup. Similar to a test bootstrap in xUnit/NUnit.

# This test class inherits from ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest, which allows full-stack requests.
# - It spins up the routing, middleware, and controller stack (not hitting a real network socket).
# - Path helpers like `pricing_url` come from Rails routes (like Url.Action in ASP.NET).
